# When Was the Golden Age of Video Games?

This project is about video game critic and user scores as well as sales data for the top 400 video games released since 1977. The golden age of video games was searched by identifying release years that users and critics liked best which led onto exploring the business side of gaming by looking at game sales data.

This search involved joining datasets and comparing results with set theory as well as filtering, grouping, and ordering data.
